## Native Behavior Contracts

### openai

- Native surface: OpenAI-style interface metadata plus neutral Agent Skills source
- Activation: Use frontmatter description for catalog routing and targets/openai/agents/openai.yaml for display name, default prompt, and compatibility metadata.
- Resources: Ship the neutral source tree and expose OpenAI-facing interface metadata as a generated companion file.
- Scripts: Keep scripts as local package resources; expose help-smoke and permission metadata for reviewer approval before execution.
- Permission enforcement: `metadata-only`; native enforcement `False`
- Review artifacts: targets/openai/agents/openai.yaml, targets/openai/adapter.json, reports/review-studio.html

### claude

- Native surface: Claude-compatible neutral source folder with adapter notes
- Activation: Use SKILL.md frontmatter description as the primary activation contract and adapter.json for review metadata.
- Resources: Preserve the source tree directly; write target notes in targets/claude/README.md.
- Scripts: Scripts remain local package resources and must be reviewed through trust and permission reports before use.
- Permission enforcement: `metadata-fallback`; native enforcement `False`
- Review artifacts: targets/claude/README.md, targets/claude/adapter.json, reports/review-studio.html

### generic

- Native surface: Agent Skills compatible neutral package
- Activation: Use SKILL.md name and description; consumers decide automatic or manual activation.
- Resources: Preserve references, scripts, assets, evals, reports, and adapter metadata as relative package resources.
- Scripts: Expose script and permission metadata for downstream clients or installers to enforce.
- Permission enforcement: `consumer-enforced-or-metadata-only`; native enforcement `False`
- Review artifacts: targets/generic/adapter.json, reports/review-studio.html
